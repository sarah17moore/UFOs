# UFOs
A classwork example in which I use JavaScript to make a dynamic table on an HTML webpage

---

# Overview
I was asked to create a table organizing UFO data that was originally stored as a JavaScript array. This table lets you filter UFO sighting data from early 2010 based on date, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO. Using JavaScript integration on an HTML webpage, this website will be available for those who are interested in viewing UFO sighting data easily and quickly. 

## Purpose
Adding city, state, country, and shape filter search boxes on this webpage will make searching the UFO sighting results user friendly. The goal is to create an easy to use webpage to help our users search for data to help them find specific sightings or aggregate common factors. Filtering for multiple items at the same time will also be beneficial to users who are interested in further analysis of UFO sighting patterns and history.

# Results
You can perform a search on this webpage by typing in a search term to the appropriate filter box and then either selecting the Enter key on the keyboard or left clicking out of the text box. This updates the data table on the webpage to only show results that match the search term:
![ufo_screenshot_2](/static/images/ufo_screenshot_2.png)
![ufo_screenshot_1](/static/images/ufo_screenshot_1.png)

After a search:
![ufo_screenshot_3](/static/images/ufo_screenshot_3.png)

# Summary 
Unfortunately, this webpage as it stands does not have a "Search" or "Go" button to complete the search. Users will need to know to click Enter or to left click out of the text box to finish the search. Adding a button would be a simple fix to the requested design and would make the site more attractive to use as well as user friendly. 

I also suggest adding a Google Form comment box via iFrame to this webpage. In the webpage description, it states:
"So what do YOU think? Are we alone in the universe? Are aliens trying to contact us, or do they want to be left alone? Dig through the data yourself, and let us know what you see."

This statement prompts the user to respond to the webmaster. There is no included contact information or comment box. Adding a simple Google Form box would be easy, would not take too much bandwidth to host, and would be informative for the webmaster.
